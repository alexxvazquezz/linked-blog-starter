There are conductores, semi conductors and non conductores. 
Ohms law
V= Voltage/Tension
I = Intensity, or current, it is measured in amps
R = Resistance. It is the resistance, the pushback of current.. conductores have less or more Resistance to current. De better the conductor, the less resistance this has. 

Temperature has an affect on a conductores resistance, some coductores become more resistante when they get hotter, and less resistante when they get colder.  SOme conductores become less resistante with heat and more with cold. 

This is also de case with the contact points of conductores. If a contact point is weak, then risistance rises, the problem with resistance rising is heat, so, if you are using coppper, that becomes more resistante as it get's hotter, if you have a bad contact, you can enter a postive feedback loop and cause a lot of heat.
