1. The first step in training any AI model si with datasets.  For example you need to  label the objects   or anything you want the AI model to learn  what the objects are and will be able to recognize i you maie seee a soccer gamr
2. Attributes and be linked to labels, like a player position, when he is runnin..or gol save.. 

If you are looking for a fast side back you can have the modal identiit al but you need to trained it with those examples

The modal starts to learno patterns like for defensive players or forwars.  The data itself also heps the modal leran action and atrribures for different players

Creating data sets is the basics to Machine learing. You can get datasets online, but knowing me,  I was to create my own datasets and learn asi I go. 

I hadn't undertood de potencials of teaching AI models and what value could comoe of it. But I realized it has a lot of popential. For example, datasets with maradona, like is game per game states.
Types of ways to generate data:
From videos like soccergames. You have to create labels annotations. (I still need to learn)

My thinking is this:
I can create more datasets about maradona and train chatbots on that information, even get his voice. then Have a maradona bot that can answer like it where him. 

That is the Goal
