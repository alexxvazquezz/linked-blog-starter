Spark Plugs:
Its recommended to use the ones with only on electrode, because you can vary de space between the electrode and the negative metal. 
Spark plugs can be colder or hotter, this measures how fast it dissipates heat, a colder one dissipates heat faster than a hot one.  This is important do manage how hot the combustion chamber can get. This is a variant very important when tuning a cars engine. 

A turbo engine has low compresion due to that fact that it need to handle boost. In some case  you need to create heat in the combustion bay because of the volumetric afficiance y bad. If you cam a sporty cam or when a turbo engine, when these are idl's have a bad.  A bad volumetric efficiancy will cause issues, the way to overcome this is to produce heat, yo ucan do this by either, Adnancing the timing, changes the AFR, to make it leaner, or using sparkplugs that are hotter... You can also us the software to make the iginition fire twice (chispa perdida).

Variables:
1. Change the relationship of the spark plugs, if it's hot or cold..
2. Ignition system, the better it is, the hotter it will run the spark plugs
3. Adncance timing, the more you advance, the hoter it will get

Danger of a very hot combustion chamber? Engine Knock. 

If you make the airflow mixture richer, this will lower the tempature becuase some of the fuel will leave the exhaust as vapor, and with it heat. So if it becomes rich, you can adnace the timing to make it hotter.

The goal is to get the peak pressure when the piston is passing TDC, think of it as a bike pedal. Since it takes time to combust all the fuel to reach the maximum pressure, different things can change the rate of combustion. Leaner fuel will make it the combustion faster, richer fuel and make is slower. More compression can make it faster, hotter combustion bay can make it faster. 

If it becomes faster, you may need to retard the timing or make the AFM richer. When you add more fuel, you make the combustion chamber cooler thus affecting the rate of combustion


**Bomba de pique,  avance de vacio**. WHen you accelerate, or a variation in the accelerator, you have a change in timing, usually pretty high, but this is a transitional period, this is due to the enrichment of the fuel. In inyecction system, you need to vary the inyection timing to make it longer. . Once the engines regulates, the timing goes back to normal and its inyection timing. 

You can modify the timing tepending on the engine load. Its not the same how an engine air flow changes depending on the load. Torque. We can vary the timing with this variable. Usually done with a MAP Sensor or MAF

Boosted engines
When it's idling, it works like a NA engine. But with a low compresion ratio and with a cold spark plug(Kneeded to help cool the engine when in boost)..
Since its a colder combustion chamber, you will need to:
- Advance the timing or making mixture leaner, or a combination of both.

When in boost, the combustion chamber will have a larger air mass, and the temperature of the combustion chamber will get hotter. What you need to do:
- Retard timing(this will still be relative. but you retard because its going to be hotter then when it idling)
- Make mixture richer (cools down combustion chamber.)


ADVANCING THE TIMING WILL ALSO HEAT UP THE COMBUSTION CHAMBER

THe maximux torque in the curve is dependent on volumetric eficiance, Usually an engines best volumentric efeciency can be found and some rpm. Where the cylinders are the most full, generating maximux torque, in this case you will need more inyection time. Becuase you have more air mas entering the chamber. 


The temperature of the exhaust changes with timing. Advanced timing witll lower the temperature of the pipe. Retarding timing witll heat it up.
