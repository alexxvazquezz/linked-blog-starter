Spark Plugs:
Its recommended to use the ones with only on electrode, because you can vary de space between the electrode and the negative metal. 
Spark plugs can be colder or hotter, this measures how fast it dissipates heat, a colder one dissipates heat faster than a hot one.  This is important do manage how hot the combustion chamber can get. This is a variant very important when tuning a cars engine. 

A turbo engine has low compresion due to that fact that it need to handle boost. In some case  you need to create heat in the combustion bay because of the volumetric afficiance y bad. If you cam a sporty cam or when a turbo engine, when these are idl's have a bad.  A bad volumetric efficiancy will cause issues, the way to overcome this is to produce heat, yo ucan do this by either, Adnancing the timing, changes the AFR, to make it leaner, or using sparkplugs that are hotter... You can also us the software to make the iginition fire twice (chispa perdida)
