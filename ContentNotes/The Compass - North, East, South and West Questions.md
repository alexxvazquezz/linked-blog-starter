## Question 
- How do I link new notes? What is the idea compass?

# Notes
Tools for thought, memory overload. They extend our mental ability and capacity. We can do more. Apps are places are vessels for good thinking. Its a sub category of tools for thoughts. 

The Zelenkasten Method, one key aspect is the power to practice, improve the cognitive characteristics of associated thinking. 

The Idea Compass, before we add a permanent note or the Atomic Idea. When we are lost we can look for a navigation system, like the compass. So the goal here is to have a navigation system to systel these ideas. 

North:
*UPSTREAM*
* Where does X come from?
* What are it's origins?
* What belief does X support?
* Zoom out, What domain exisists?  (Don't uderstand)
* Whate gave birth to x?
* What coused it?

West:
*REINFORCING*
* What is similliar to X?
* What other disciplines could X already exist in?
* What other disciplines could X benefit from?

South:
*DOWNSTREAM*
* Where can X lead to?
* What does X contribute to?
* What could X be the heading of?

East
*TRANSFORMATIVE*
* What competes with X?
* What is oppising X?
* What is X missing?
* What is the disadvantage with X?
* 

YOu don't have to ask all the questions. sometimes with one directino is fine.
