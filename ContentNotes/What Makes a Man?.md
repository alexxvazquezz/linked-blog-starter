## Question 
 What are you going to do about your incompetence... when you are young this is your situation. 
What should you to about your life. (this is a bad question.) 



## Evidence 
Look at other people..

Think about a job as a dishwasher. how? Showing up on time, 

* if you work 10% longer you make 40% more money. This is one of the reasons men make more money than women on average. Great ROI (return on investment). You have opportunities to learn how to run a kitchen as a dishwasher. Lateral movements from withing the organization.  Try to always be the best at what you do. 


## Conclusion
Find a partner... but don't look for one, become the man that woman will want to be with. 
Figure out what your are good at and get good at it. To get good at something you must become skilled at many other skills to achieve. 

It must feel great to be the best at something. 

Develop a vision for yourself... 
Can you get a partner. how will she be
Can you fight temptation. sexual and drug 
Do i go to church or political party? civic duties
Invision yourself, who you'd like to be and become it. Fix yourself.
