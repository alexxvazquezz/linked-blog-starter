# Hierarchy

France Dewall (studies chimps)
They have a patriarchal social structure. The male is the dominant.. over females

Marxist Biologists establish that hierarchy are dominant hierarchies and is lead by the most dominant male who is wiling to use arbitrary force and compulsion.


But Dewall has shown that even the weaker chimps can become the leader if they have the support of other chimps or the dominant older female that has good social connection within the group. He is extremely good at reconciliation post conflict. If he can create peace 

What we're properly governed by is?
"The spirit of voluntary play"

They are taught that their ambitions is corrupt. If you believe this you will suffer the shadow problem All the ambitions, aggression that lives within them goes underground. This is what account for most of crime, gang crime. Status jocking. Men are very interested in status, because women choice by status. But his is not entirely true.

A sophisticated women is interested in a man that can generate resources. A man born into money, vs a man with less money who's prospects are bright. A sensible women will choose the prospect. 

Women get a bad rap for being hypergamous.. Women have a preference for this. Its due to female collaboration mechanism. Because of the inequality of infant care. She need a man that can fill the gap and help..This is based on a mans competent. She does not want a another child. 


Every single highschool shooter was fatherless. 

The more self conscious you are the more miserable you are. For example.. if you go to a party thinking about how to make everyone else happy or have a good time, you won;'t feel anxious. Focus on other people. If you think bout only yourself, you will feel anxious.. 
Adam and eve become self conscious.
