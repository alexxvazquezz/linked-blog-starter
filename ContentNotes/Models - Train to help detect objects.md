Labeling and detecting objects is a tedious task. A technic it to train a model to detect certain objects, and then use these model en the labeling process. 

- **Label a Small Initial Dataset**:
    
    - Label **players only** in about 50–100 frames to create a starter dataset.
    - Use bounding boxes to label each player consistently, ensuring you capture players in various poses and locations on the field for variety.
- **Train a Basic Object Detection Model**:
    
    - Use a pre-trained object detection model (like YOLO or Faster R-CNN) to speed up training. These models have existing knowledge of people and objects, which helps them adapt to detecting soccer players.
    - Fine-tune the model with your labeled frames. You don’t need a large dataset for this initial training—start small, then retrain as you label more data.
- **Test and Refine**:
    
    - Run the model on a set of new frames and review its predictions.
    - Correct any inaccuracies (such as missed players or incorrect bounding box placements) to improve the model’s output.
    - This corrected data can then be added to your dataset for further model training.
- **Iterate and Expand**:
    
    - As the model improves, continue using it to help label more frames. Each time, add the corrected labels back into the dataset, gradually expanding the data used for training.
    - After several rounds of labeling and retraining, the model will become faster and more accurate in identifying players.
