## Question 
- {{What is the main question or issue being addressed in the content?}} 
	 Does a great outcome require a great effort? We tend to believe that a simple change it the way we work can have a big impact on our outcome and even make it more fun, as long as is aligns with our goals and we feel like we are in control. 
	 The problem is when we have a work flow that can't adapt and we lose control. 

	Resistance goes against productivity, that's why it is important for the system to be adaptive and flexible. 

## Evidence 
- {{What evidence, arguments, or key points are presented?}} 

	Effortless Work:
	Our work needs to be set up in a way that is flexible to allow small changes, this way we can keep our interests, motivations and work aligned. This also reduces resistance, that that drives us to not work and continue. Highly productive people deflect resistance.



## Conclusion
- {{What is the conclusion or key takeaway from the content?}} 
Flexibility helps with feeling in control and being able to shift without to much hassle. This also helps with resistance, making it easier to add on or to make changes to this system. It is also important to have a place to organize your thoughts and ideas, but the most important aspect is to be able to reach them. Writing is thinking.
You have to extrenalize yoiur ideas, you need to write. 

## Quotes/Key Points 
- Success is not the result of strong willpower and the ability to overcome resistance, but rather the result of smart working environments that avoid resistnance in the first place (cf. Neal et al. 2012;  Painter et al. 2002; Hearn et al. 1998)
- Henry Ford's conveyor belt. Such a simple change, but what a huge impact.
