## Question 
- How do people make decisions, and what role do intuition and logic play?

## Evidence 
- Kahneman explains that we have two systems of thinking: 
	- System 1 is fast, intuitive, and often operates subconsciously. 
	- System 2 is slower, more deliberate, and logical. 
	- Experiments show that System 1 is prone to biases, while System 2 requires effort and is less frequently engaged.

## Conclusion 
- Kahneman concludes that while System 1 is efficient for everyday decisions, over-reliance on it leads to biases and errors in judgment. System 2 should be engaged for more important, complex decisions. 

## Key Ideas 
- System 1 helps with routine tasks but is prone to cognitive biases. 
- System 2 is used for more complex problem-solving and requires more effort.


## Quotes/Key Points 
- "System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional; System 2 is slower, more deliberate, and more logical." (p. 45)

## Reflections 
- Kahnemanâ€™s distinction between the two systems helps me think about my own decision-making process, particularly when I rely too heavily on quick judgments.
