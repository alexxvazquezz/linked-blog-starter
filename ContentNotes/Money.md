How to make money? You should be concentrating on how to take money. Since we cannot make money, we can only take money from somebody else. 

Taking Money as a mindset
You need to change the way you think about money, most of use think in terms of making money, but only the federal reserve can take money. The idea is to shift your mindset into taking money. You can only take money from someone else. 

Money can only be created by the federal reserve, and they do this in order to inslave us.

It's not smart to save money, due to inflation, and money is printed everyday. Find a way to take, you cannot make or save. You can ONLY TAKE.
