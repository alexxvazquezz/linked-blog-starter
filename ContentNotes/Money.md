How to make money? You should be concentrating on how to take money. Since we cannot make money, we can only take money from somebody else. 

Taking Money as a mindset
You need to change the way you think about money, most of use think in terms of making money, but only the federal reserve can take money. The idea is to shift your mindset into taking money. You can only take money from someone else. 

Money can only be created by the federal reserve, and they do this in order to inslave us.

It's not smart to save money, due to inflation, and money is printed everyday. Find a way to take, you cannot make or save. You can ONLY TAKE. 

GET RID OF THE IDEA OF SAVING> SAVING WILL NOT MAKE YOU RICH. 

Money is like water and move around. It flows. This ideas is a great way of looking at it. 

**Ways to Make Money**

2. [[Information for Money <PN>]]
	Your time is not linked to the information you know. If you make a video, you can sell a video about what you know, but know that information is not tied to you time. 
	If you can get information and attention, you will be rich. There must be something you know. Monotize that...
	Is there a theory about some kind of ripple affect with time?
