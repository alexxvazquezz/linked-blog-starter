## Question 
- How to be listened to??
	- You need to speak clearly and loudly 
	- Appear less aggressive by changing you body language.. if you are big you need to look smaller
	- Use your hands to make the point. Think consciously how you are expressing yourself and how to strike.
	- You need your own style, you can replicate someone elses, it appears as not authentic
- How to speak convincingly?
	- Speak effectively
	- User your voice. They need not to be clear and with conviction.. DO NOT USE "UM" or "AM".
	- You need to use space.. your body.. and speak loudly.  
	- You are the baddest mother fucker. Does not matter what you are doing. You need to walk in like you own the place.. you are the MAN. You do with the girl as you do with the man.. The same masculine aspect are attractive with men and women. 
	- Humans are really good with detecting change. 
	- Change your body language. Flip it from aggressive to sensitive. Or sensitive to aggressive. That shift will make people double guess. 
- Smiling: It is effective but it need to be selective. Your smile should have value, if you rarely smile it has value when you use it. Smile when its deserved. When something with maret happens. It is a selective tool. Make it worth something. Smile when they are receptive.
- Look in the eyes when you talk. Don't look like a psychhhhho.. Use eye contact to drive the point in. Use it as ponctuation. When you look into the eyes it because you mean it. 
- You need     to make it clear that you are listening. It makes them feel important. Pretend that you are listening.
