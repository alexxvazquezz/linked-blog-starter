No one is going to fix your life. You are out here alone
Below are the 4 tenants you need to live by to achieve the g-mindset
- [[No one is going to save you <PN>]]
- [[You should be angry at your current situation <PN>]]
- [[You should believe that you can accomplish anything <PN>]]
- [[Set in Stone Honesty <PN>]]

Once you say it you have to do. This mindset is what give you the power of unlimited motivation. 

You need to have a sense of urgency. When you say something it should be set to stone
