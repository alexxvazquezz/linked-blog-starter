# Summary
Words are valuable, they are real. But if we say something about what we are going to do, and do not do this, we lie to ourselves, we become dishonest. This makes me thinks that if we stick with what we say, we become more honest, and in return, more real with who we are. This is why it's very important to be careful with your words. Once its out of your mouth, it should be set to stone.
