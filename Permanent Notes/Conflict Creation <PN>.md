Before post Marxism, the conflict of powers was between the working class and the rich or owners of production. Since that was proven wrong, post Marxism creates a dialect in society, putting man against nature like global warming, men vs woman, feminism, and minorities against anything.. so they create conflict so the state can intervene, when the state intervenes it grows and can later weld more power.
