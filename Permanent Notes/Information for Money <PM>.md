# Summary

 You can monotize the information you have, like making a tutorial. You spend time on this, but after it's created it can be resold and resold, this is no longer attached  to your time but rather detached. This is a way to multiply your time. 
 This is better then [[Time for Money  <PM>]], but you need to create credability first. And if you can get attention and have information, you'll be rich.
