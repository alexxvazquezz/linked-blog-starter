# Summary

Since money is on the move, it's is vulnerable. Using this analogy... Robbers when they used to highjack trains, they would do it when it had money, that was on the move. WHen it was in a bank they would usually not rob since it was harder to take. 

The idea is to find a place where the money is moving and where it is vulnerable. If you see money moving you need to stand in the middle of the money.  ATTACK THE MONEY.
