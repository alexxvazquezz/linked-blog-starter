# Summary

Trading a product or a service for money is how most people have a business. You can search for products and sell it for a mark up and branding it or sell service. There are issues here. Selling products is monopolized, unless you find a unique product and brand it correctly. And selling a service for money is the same as selling your time, except you may make more money. But again, you time is tied up. You want to free yourself so you can make more money.
