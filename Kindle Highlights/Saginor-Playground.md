The need for new thrills and more adventure becomes essential. I crave daily doses of chaos. My desire for stimulation intensifies and spending time with people whose lives revolve around drama becomes the quickest fix. It’s an addictive lifestyle. When we cannot find the drama, we create it out of anything and nothing. It’s a vicious circle, as I inevitably begin to believe the reality I’ve created. — location: [2368](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FCK6AC&location=2368) ^ref-49635
