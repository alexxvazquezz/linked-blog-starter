Living a life where woman can submit to, and not be forced to. Woman submit characteristics of masculinity. 

Self Control = Masculinity, and give a woman a sense of security. 

He makes great fantastic decisions, hast self control when it comes to sex, money food in general.. He has a life that he can be proud of and he has self respect on who he is..Woman will naturally submit and focus on being a woman, rasing the children and looking after him. 
WOman sees that he can control urges, she get frustraded, hast to take the lead and resentment. She has another child


Consecuence.. She will lose respect, and leave in time


Masculinity. Protect, ability to provide.

Men have easy access to sex, so they don't have to develop masculine traits. This seems to have inhanced the masuclnity in woman. They practive detached sex. Men are disposible. No children, no long term plans. 

This detachecment woman are fealing, is this part of why so much prostitution? Onlyfans and just the interest in money

Do men only sex? Men really want intimacy with women. It's the combination between intimacy and sex. Intimate Sex
