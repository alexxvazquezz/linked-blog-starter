## Question 
What is reinforcement learning

Agent in a maze. It will take an action according to its context. I will get a reward if it takes correct action. By doing this process, it will learn. What actions give good rewards, and what actions give negative results. 

The environment is where actions take place. For example, if I and cooking an egg my environment is that kitchen. I need to make actions in order to make this egg. 

Actions should be taken in the correct time. You can't but the eggs if the oil is to hot, or the salt before the egg. 

Simplest way to understanding reinforcement learning is thinking of training a dog. +1 is positive, -1 is negative. 

Threw this learning process, the agent or ai sytem learns fast and sometimes does things better then a pre programmed system. These systems can adapt. 

This is very different, a completely different world thin preprogrammed software.
