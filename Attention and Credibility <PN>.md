# Summary

To be able to sell your information for money, you need to establish credibility and garner attention. There are free ways to get information in the present, but people buy information from people that get attention. Think about learning to play a guitar from someone that plays uniquely, or a DJ that travels the world. Know all of a sudden his information has value, because of the attention he/she receives.
