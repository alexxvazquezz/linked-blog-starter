After that, runnind paid ads take 30-60 minutes a day
Organic tiktok takers longer because you need to make content. 
2-3 hours a day of focused effort every single day.

Finding a winning product is key.

# What Type of Store Should You Create?
There are 3 types of stores:
	 General stores
	 Niche stores
	 One product stores

They Recommend niche stores, as it allows to test multiple products fast without having to start over every single time.

General stores can work but I'd be competing with walmart or amazon etc. 

One product stores are good. But it is hard to increase your Average order value/Life time value if you only have one product. 

So, niche is the best. 

# Why will people buy from me instead of Amazon/Aliexpress?

I will be targeting customers with paid ads or orgainic Tiktok that are impulse buyers. 
When you show customers an innovative new product with a strong wow factor, they dont know if it's available.. so they buy directly.
